ml_edm : A python package for Machine Learning for Early Decision Making tasks
Repository: https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm

Many situations require decisions to be made quickly to avoid the costs associated with delaying the decision. A doctor who needs to choose which test to perform on their patient and an agent considering whether a certain behavior on a network is caused by a hacker are examples of individuals confronted with such situations. However, taking a decision too hastily may lead to more mistakes, resulting in additional costs that could have been avoided. 

In these situations, where there is a trade-off between the earliness of the decision and the accuracy of the prediction, the Machine Learning for Early Decision Making (ML-EDM) framework offers AI solutions not only to make a prediction but also to decide when to trigger its associated decision.

The ml_edm package provides tools to facilitate dealing with the early classification of time series (ECTS) problem, whose goal is to determine the class associated with a time series before it reaches its last timestamp/measurement T as early as possible.

A detailed guide on how to install and use the package can be found in the “Get Started” notebook available in the repository. This notebook can be explored by downloading the repository and using jupyter notebook. Documentation can be found in the notebook and in the source code.
